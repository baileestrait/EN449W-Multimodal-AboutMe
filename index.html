        <p class ="bodyParagraph"> I'm 22 years old and currently a senior at UNA majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in HCI/UX Design and I'm expected to graduate in December this year! <br>
          <br>
          I grew up in Killen (about 25 minutes from Florence), and graduated from Rogers High School in 2020. In 2021, I attended Northwest Shoals Community College where I graduated with my Associate's degree in 2023 before transferring to UNA.

        <h4 class="sectionHeader"> Morning or Night?</h4>
        <p class="bodyParagraph"> I'm adaptable as either a morning person or a night owl, but find myself typically more productive in the earlier hours of the day. I enjoy drinking cold water or some type of fruit juice (usually apple) to help me take my daily medications and start my day off. </p>
